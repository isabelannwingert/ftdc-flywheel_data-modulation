# ftdc-flywheel_data-modulation
GitHub Repository for Penn FTDC for Flywheel Specific scripts/gears/etc. This repository exists for the Penn FTD Center to utilize and adapt to the new FlyWheel system. A lot of new users upon first glance at FlyWheel and its services it offers often get led to confusion, because of an expectation of knowledge of informatics, the introduction of intermediate steps, and the steps to process and navigate FlyWheel not being concisely outlined in a beginner-friendly manner in the available documentation. This repository is to lessen that liklihood of confusion, and to complete the necessary steps of modifying Flywheel data in a lab-specific/FlyWheel beginner friendly manner.
